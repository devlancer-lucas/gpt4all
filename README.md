## Features

* Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, MacOSX, iOS, Android, Embedded Linux, QNX)
* Fast CPU based inference using ggml for GPT-J based models
* The UI is made to look and feel like you've come to expect from a chatty gpt
* Easy to install... The plan is to create precompiled binaries for major platforms with easy installer including model

## Contributing

* Pull requests welcome :)
