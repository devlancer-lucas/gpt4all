# GPT4All

GTP4All is an ecosystem to train and deploy **powerful** and **customized** large language models that run locally on consumer grade CPUs.


## Models

A GPT4All model is a 3GB - 8GB file that you can download and plug into the GPT4All open-source ecosystem software. **Nomic AI** supports and maintains this software ecosystem to enforce quality and security alongside spearheading the effort to allow any person or enterprise to easily train and deploy their own on-edge large language models. 

See FAQ for frequently asked questions about GPT4All model backends.


## Best Practices
GPT4All models are designed to run locally on your own CPU. Large prompts may require longer computation time and
result in worse performance. Giving an instruction to the model will typically produce the best results.
